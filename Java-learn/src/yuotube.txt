i have figured out a way to complete all

of my daily coding tasks in just four

hours with no breaks and i believe you

can do it too now that really only

leaves you with two questions how

and why how are you able to complete

everything and why don't you take any

breaks i mean after all so many people

are told you need to work in small

chunks and take breaks in between like

the pomodoro technique 25 minutes on

five minutes off it just doesn't work

for coding think about it you look at a

line of code think about it for a second

and translate it to plain english and

then you figure out what that code

actually does how it relates to the rest

of the code what that other code does

you're making all of this progress then

oh time to take my break

you take a stroll around the block maybe

get a cup of coffee then get back to

work except now your entire train of

thought is lost and you have to start

back at square one so tell me again how

this is supposed to increase my

productivity when it's designed to break

my focus every 25 minutes it just

doesn't work for me and i'd like to

think it doesn't work for most

programmers so what does

the answer is simple oh you want to code

for four hours straight okay well then

just

sit down and

start coding but as simple as it seems

it's just not that easy i mean you have

the ultimate distraction right in front

of your face the computer with endless

amounts of content to consume and

distractions to be had but i formulated

a way that allows me to maximize my

efficiency in that four hour ultra high

focus phase that i like to share with

you it isn't foolproof there are some

days where you just feel like you can't

get anything done but it's what works

best for me and why i'm able to code for

four hours with no breaks

unless i really got a pit

[Music]

but none of this happens without my

coffee my cometier flash frozen at peak

flavor delivers straight to your

doorstep each month coffee as someone

who primarily drinks their coffee black

the flavor of the actual coffee is most

important i make mine by running the

capsule under hot water to loosen the

frozen puck drop it into my cup pour in

my hot water that melts the puck and

enjoy the best cup of coffee i've ever

had it's smooth delicious and i can

actually taste the notes of chocolate

and berry which is typically hard for me

to do in traditional coffees i've been

taking this on our beach days and on our

boat days i just put the capsule in the

cooler and once it melts i pour it over

my ice water i don't tell but sometimes

instead of water i'll pour it over ice

milk to make myself a little latte if

you haven't tried it it's really good

it's subscription based so you sign up

once pick your roast preference and

delivery frequency and they'll ship

customized boxes to your doorstep so if

you've been wanting to try commenter now

is the time for a limited time you can

get 40 off across your first two orders

when you use my code farce k40 at

commenter.com using the link at the top

of the description i appreciate comments

here for sponsoring today's video now

back to it so what is this four hour

ultra high focus phase of the day i'm

talking about it's a four hour block of

consistent work no distractions no

breaks no lollygagging so you can get

all of your most important work done as

efficiently and quickly as possible and

it starts yesterday stand-up meetings

have it all wrong you're telling me

first thing in the morning every morning

i'm to tell you this is what i did

yesterday this is what i'm going to do

today and here are the problems i'm

facing horrible idea why would you waste

your valuable cognitive resources first

thing in the morning was something so

trivial instead do it at the end of

yesterday that's where this starts plan

your work yesterday or you know plan

your work for tomorrow today you get

what i'm saying what do i need to do

tomorrow list them out choose one or two

as the highest priority and you want to

schedule those in your most optimal time

frame for me that's in the morning when

my brain is fresh i have used no

cognitive resources on mundane tasks

like emails or meetings the most

intensive work i've done is poured

myself a cup of coffee so most of the

time this four hour no break window

occurs anywhere between 8 am and 1 pm

depending on when i wake up but this

isn't set in stone don't let perfection

be the enemy of progress there are many

days where that window won't be until

after lunch somewhere between 1pm and

6pm but how does one stay focused for

four hours straight this is the bread

and butter and first and foremost it's

easier when you're doing something you

enjoy groundbreaking i know but there's

only so much you can force yourself to

do if you dislike it and i mean really

dislike it not just dislike the idea of

it because oftentimes we think of a task

think of something that we need to do

and we don't want to do it that doesn't

mean you dislike it it means you dislike

the idea of it that's why it's advised

to just start off with a 5 10 15 minute

task or something little to begin with

if you're procrastinating or need to

find motivation and then you find

yourself an hour or two later and you're

just still working it's because you you

may like the work

the idea of it is what you don't force

yourself to start and then just let

yourself flow that's the entire goal and

solution as to how enter into that flow

state and don't let anything take you

out of it that's why i call it the four

hour ultra high focus phase of the day

there can be no distractions no phone no

text no notifications no emails and no

slack so set your status as busy coding

until noon so nobody bothers you and if

i must say as someone who has two

monitors right in front of them

only use one monitor but first i need

four monitors for maximum productivity i

have this open over here the docs open

over here my my project management

software over here my id over here what

i'm working on over here

that's not what i mean

what i mean is that a lot of individuals

if you're like me

tend to have your work monitor and then

have your leisure monitor you put on a

youtube video maybe this youtube video

you put on a stream you maybe have

reddit or twitter open on that second

monitor because you just need something

going on in the background but that is a

potential distraction you cannot

multitask not in this phase i'll say it

again this is your four hour ultra high

focus phase the reason being

is because the next four hours of work

given you work a eight-hour workday you

have meetings you have emails you have

whatever other mundane tasks that you

have to do

that is when you can multitask that is

when you can watch a video or a stream

or browse reddit while doing the other

things that you have to do for work i'm

not pitching a four hour workday i'm

pitching a four hour ultra high focus

phase yeah i guess i've kind of coined

that at this point i just typed it a

bunch nothing should be going on except

you coding

that's it but i do have to admit

something

this method doesn't actually work not by

itself at least uh-huh got you there for

a second you're asking your brain to

work with ultra high focus doing a

cognitively taxing task for four hours

straight because you're demanding

yourself to have a healthy mind it

doesn't work unless you have a healthy

body so drink enough water take your

vitamins especially your b12 if you want

enough energy to stay focused because

almost every cell in your body uses b12

and the b12 deficiency causes tiredness

but only take this after eating only

take this in the morning but also don't

listen to me because i'm not a health

professional and exercise preferably

outside so you can get some sun on your

face trust me

that helps but also don't trust me

because i'm not a health professional

but also doctors are considered health

professionals and half of them don't

know what the hell they're talking about

anyway all of these things are why i'm

able to code for four hours with no

breaks so if you haven't found something

that's able to maximize efficiency and

stay focused for yourself i'd love for

you to try this the way that is never

talked about because everyone thinks you

should be taking a break every 30

minutes try it out see if it works for

you let me know in the comments if you

do plan to try it out and then come back

later with your results good and bad

because this isn't a one size fits all

approach nothing is maybe try three hour

blocks instead of four hour blocks maybe

try it in the evening instead of in the

morning like me and never never

focus

so heavily on the deadlines and time

frame oh i gotta finish all of this in

four hours no no don't worry about all

of that

just get in the flow state have an

understanding of what you have to do

and roll if you have a friend that you

think would find this video to be

helpful there is a share button right

below this video there's also a like

button right over there as well as a

subscribe button and then a notification

bell if you're already subscribed which

by the way i don't upload that much

anyway so it's not like i'm going to be

bombarding your notifications but until

the next notification
